# nodeAuth
A basic register login system using mLab and express, created by following the tutorial by Eduonix,

**however, the render engine used by me is EJS unlike the video which used Jade.** Translating was a fun experience in itself.
Change the user.js file to use your own mLab account, hope it helps you.

Also, I can't get the logout button to redirect the user to the login page, I made sure my code was correct but it just gave me a 404 error, see if you can help me fix it.

And the port is set to 3001, in case you start it on 3000 and it shows nothing.
